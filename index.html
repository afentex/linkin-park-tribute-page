                    <p>It starts with one</p>
                    <p>All I know</p>
                    <p>It's so unreal</p>
                    <p>Watch you go</p>
                    <p>I tried so hard and got so far</p>
                    <p>But in the end, it doesn't even matter</p>
                    <p>I had to fall to lose it all</p>
                    <p>But in the end, it doesn't even matter</p>
                    <p>One thing, I don't know why</p>
                    <p>It doesn't even matter how hard you try</p>
                    <p>Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme</p>
                    <p>To remind myself of a time when I tried so hard</p>
                    <p>In spite of the way you were mockin' me</p>
                    <p>Actin' like I was part of your property</p>
                    <p>Remembering all the times you fought with me</p>
                    <p>I'm surprised it got so far</p>
                    <p>Things aren't the way they were before</p>
                    <p>You wouldn't even recognize me anymore</p>
                    <p>Not that you knew me back then</p>
                    <p>But it all comes back to me in the end</p>
                    <p>You kept everything inside</p>
                    <p>And even though I tried, it all fell apart</p>
                    <p>What it meant to me will eventually</p>
                    <p>Be a memory of a time when I</p>
                    <p>I tried so hard and got so far</p>
                    <p>But in the end, it doesn't even matter</p>

                    <p>It doesn't even matter how hard you try</p>
                    <p>Keep that in mind</p>
                    <p>I designed this rhyme to explain in due time</p>
                    <p>All I know</p>
                    <p>Time is a valuable thing</p>
                    <p>Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings</p>
                    <p>Watch it count down to the end of the day</p>
                    <p>The clock ticks life away</p>
                    <p>It's so unreal</p>
                    <p>You didn't look out below</p>
                    <p>Watch the time go right out the window</p>
                    <p>Tryin' to hold on, they didn't even know</p>
                    <p>I wasted it all just to watch you go</p>
                    <p>I kept everything inside</p>
                    <p>And even though I tried, it all fell apart</p>
                    <p>What it meant to me will eventually be a memory</p>
                    <p>Of a time when I tried so hard</p>
